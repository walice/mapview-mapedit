# Overview

This is a short introduction to using the `mapedit` R package developed by Tim Applehans and others. For more information I encourage you to check out: [https://www.r-spatial.org/r/2019/03/31/mapedit_leafpm.html](https://www.r-spatial.org/r/2019/03/31/mapedit_leafpm.html)


## Setup

You will need the `sf`, `mapedit` and `leaflet` packages.

```{r setup, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)

library(sf)
library(mapedit)
library(leaflet)
```

## Load data

The `seaweed_range_lines` shapefile contains multiple polyline objects that identify native ranges of seaweed around the world. I created it by hand for a paper on [seaweed aquaculture potential (Froehlich et al. 2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960982219308863).

```{r}
seaweed <- read_sf("data/seaweed_range_lines.shp")
head(seaweed)
plot(seaweed)
mapview(seaweed)
```

## Create a spatial object from scratch

Open up a blank leaflet map using the `editMap()` function and begin building lines, polygons or points. When done click finished and you have a list. To get the final as a simple feature select the data $finished.

```{r}
# Create blank map using leaflet()
seaweed_lines <- editMap(leaflet() %>% addTiles())
sw_lines <- seaweed_lines$finished

mapview(sw_lines)
class(sw_lines)

#save using write_sf
write_sf(sw_lines, "Data/seaweed_range_lines", driver = "ESRI Shapefile")
```

## Edit a shapefile

Can I edit a shapefile? (answer: yes!)

Let's edit the seaweed lines shapefile
```{r}
new_lines <- mapview(seaweed) %>%
  editMap("seaweed")
# Make sure to click Save and then Done when you edit

# Then plot new shapefile using $all
mapview(new_lines$all)
```
